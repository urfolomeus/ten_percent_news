# Contributing

The easiest way to collaborate on the project is to fork it to your own GitHub repo,
make your changes on a feature branch and then submit a pull request (PR) back to the
main repo.

This makes it easy to track changes and hopefully cuts down on the amount of conflicts.

The process is as follows:

1. Open the main repo in GitHub.
2. Click the Fork button in the top right-hand corner to make a copy on your own GitHub account.
3. `git clone git@github.com:your_github_user/ten_percent_new.git` to get the repo locally.
4. `git checkout -b name_of_feature` to create a feature branch to work from.
5. When you are finished submit a PR to the main repo (TODO: need step by step here)
